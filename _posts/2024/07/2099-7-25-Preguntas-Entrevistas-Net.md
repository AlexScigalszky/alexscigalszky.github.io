# Angular/JS Questions
## Javascript
### Easy (Junior)
This questions go from easy to more technical and hard.
⭐ What is the difference between == and === in JS and what are truthy and falsy values in JS 
A) What is a truthy/falsy value difference when using typeof and instanceof
⭐ Can you mention what primitive types JS haves? A) What is the difference for using lower case string compared to upper case String?

⭐ what ways we have to do async programming?
A) What are Promises in JavaScript?
B) Can you explain your experience with chainable promises and concurrent promises? , async-await, promises
c) async await experience and error handling? try-catch, catch()
d) other ways you had used to handle async programming? callbacks, reactive, rxjs
### Hard (Senior)
⭐ How the keyword this works in JS?
⭐ What is an execution context in JS 
A) Global execution context 
B) Function execution context 
C) what is initialized on an execution context both global vs function

F) what is explicit binding (bind, call, apply) and how it affects the “this” keyword 
G) What is the difference between an arrow function and a regular function? 
H) 
⭐ What is a closure? How prototypal inheritance works  - Un closure en JavaScript es una función que recuerda el entorno en el que fue creada, lo que le permite acceder y manipular variables fuera de su ámbito habitual incluso después de que la función que lo creó haya finalizado su ejecución.
A) How it works on typewrappers like String? 
B) can you change the implementation of a function like toString?
NOTE: Add algorithms questions inside of this section also performance specific?
### Design patterns and good practices
⭐ Can you mention some design patterns you had implemented (not angular in built but your own implementation)
⭐ what are SOLID principles can you mention at least a couple of examples and how you had applied this?
⭐ Good and bad practices you had implemented or corrected (DRY for example, boolean trap, magic numbers etc.)
### Multiparadigm
⭐ What is JS Functional programming? A) Higher Order Functions B) Pure Functions C) Function Composition D)  Immutability
⭐ What is JavaScript Object Oriented Programming A) classes B) inheritance C)  abstraction D) what the keyword super does in a class?
NOTE: Maybe add reactive programming or ask a question related to this in fucntional programming related to RxJS?
Typescript
can you describe what is typescript?
⭐ What are the five key data structures? Array functions?
A) Array, Objects, Map, Set, Symbols
⭐ what are interfaces?
⭐ What is the difference between a type and an interface in TypeScript
⭐ Is static typing faster than dynamic typing
⭐ What is the difference between “Unknown,” “Any” and “Never” in TypeScript? not use any it’s a bad practice, there can be a way where this is necessary.
Angular
What is two way binding and what is one way binding?
⭐ Can you describe the keyparts of a component definition in angular?
⭐ Can you mention some life cycle hooks in an Angular component?
Do you know how standalone component works?
Do you know how pipes work? A) Some examples B) Do you know how to create a custom pipe?
⭐ async pipe usage
⭐ What features of angular router do you have experience with? (interceptros, route guards, lazy loading, template router-link, dinamic route redirection from components)
⭐ Difference between a structural and an attribute directive A) do you know how custom directives work? what are the key things you need to set up a custom directive? B) Are custom directives attribute or structural directives?
⭐ what ways we have in angular to share data between components?
⭐ Do you know how to create a singleton service? (provideIn: 'root' )
Had you impelemented an style guide before? A) John papa or Airbnb style guide describe B) if yes how did you implemented?
⭐ can you tell me what is RXJS? A) What is an observable B) What is the difference between a subscription and an observable? C) What are RxJS Operators? — what is the difference between switchMap and mergeMap
    switchMap:
        Supongamos que estás construyendo un formulario de búsqueda en tiempo real en una aplicación web. Quieres realizar una nueva búsqueda cada vez que el usuario ingresa un nuevo término de búsqueda, pero solo te interesa mostrar los resultados de la búsqueda más reciente.
        En este caso, podrías usar switchMap para cancelar la búsqueda anterior y realizar una nueva búsqueda cada vez que se ingresa un nuevo término de búsqueda.

    mergeMap:
        Imagina que estás desarrollando una aplicación de chat donde los mensajes de diferentes usuarios llegan en tiempo real. Quieres mostrar todos los mensajes en tiempo real en la pantalla, independientemente del orden en que lleguen.
        Aquí, podrías usar mergeMap para manejar los mensajes entrantes de varios usuarios concurrentemente y mostrarlos en la pantalla en el orden en que llegan, sin importar cuál llegue primero.


 D) Can you mention a few operators you had used? C) what is a subject? Objeto que permite emitir valores D) what is a behavior subject? un sibject que guarda el último valor E) unsubscribe on ngOnDestroy
do you know how to create state management in an app? — State management using services with RXJS — NgRx for state management how it works and how you had implemented this? — What is an effect in NgRx
⭐ Some good practices that you can recommend me when working with modules? (Angular apps)
⭐  Performance techniques that you know in angular? — OnPush strategy on components — Lazy loading — threeshaking by implementing “provideIn: root” in @Injectable for singleton service (Angular por referencias elimina aquelllo que no se está usando) — Although the architecutre and strucutre of your project doesn’t help for perfomance it adds scalability and productivity to the formula
What is a circular dependency anti pattern?
How Dependency Injection works in angular
⭐ Unit testing in Angular A) what is your opinion in unit testing in Front end in general? B) What kind of unit test are you covering in your last project? C) What is anguilar test bed and how to set up? D( experience using jasmine/karma or jest
CSS and UI libraries
⭐ Do you have exprience with responsiv edesign?
⭐ what is the mobile first approach

⭐ Experience using Grid and Flex
Can both be mixed or is this a bad practice?
⭐What experience with other libraries do you have?
# Personal

Years of experience for JS in general? js9 angular7
Extra Points if they mention
