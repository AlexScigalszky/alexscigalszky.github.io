## Work Experience

### Unosquare Notified Event Editor (2022-Today)

**Role:** .Net + Angular Developer

Notified is a communication cloud for events, public relations, and investor relations. It provides clients with the tools needed to reach and engage customers, investors, employees, and the media. I worked on the event editor, a page builder where clients can customize the public pages of an event. The event editor includes several parts: the page editor, the page builder, and the theme (with multiple visual styles). All these parts were built using a data-driven concept where I developed general components based on data, improved stored procedures, and created multiple unit and integration tests in both frontend and backend to enhance the project's health for other contributors and stakeholders.

- **Team:** 3 developers and 2 testers
- **Responsibilities:** Involved in frontend and backend development, bug fixing, adding new features, and writing unit tests to improve software quality
- **Technologies:** SQL Server, .Net Core/Net Framework, Angular, XUnit, Jest, Git, Azure DevOps

Worked in multiple teams (backend, frontend, tester) and adopted a sprint methodology mid-development. Also made small changes in Mailroom’s logistics software.
